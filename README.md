# Emu.Resources
Welcome to the resource repository for Emu.

_Emu is an interactive structural analysis and form-finding tool based on a 6DOF (6 degrees of freedom) formulation of the dynamic relaxation method allowing engineers and designers to run bi-axial bending and torsion simulations in the parametric environment of Grasshopper3d. It is aimed to be used in early design stages but yet giving real structural feedback._
