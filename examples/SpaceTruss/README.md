# Space Truss

## Description
This example shows how to analyze a 3D truss with large deformations using the DR solver and visualize the normal forces on the displaced configuration. The definition also demonstrates how the reaction force component can be used to visualize the reactions as arrows (see picture below).

## Instructions
1. Download the [definition](Emu_SpaceTruss.gh)
2. Open the definition in Rhino 5 or 6.
3. Start the simulation by double clicking on the timer component.
